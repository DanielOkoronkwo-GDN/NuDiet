## Architectural Enhancement: SwiftData + TCA Integration
To enhance the architecture and user experience, I propose integrating SwiftData alongside The Composable Architecture (TCA). This approach enables efficient local filtering and lookup of recipes based on user-defined criteria such as tags and other filters.

Note: As not all recipes may be retrieved initially, certain filter combinations may yield partial results until the complete dataset is available.
